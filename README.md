##GENETIC SEQUENCING USING THE TRAVELLING SALESMAN PROBLEM


We present a novel approach to genome assembly and haplotype phasing using concepts from the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and search
algorithms. Our method, called GenomeTSP, models the genome assembly problem as finding an optimal path through sequence reads, similar
to solving a TSP. A modified A* search algorithm is used to efficiently explore the assembly
graph and identify the optimal assembly path.
